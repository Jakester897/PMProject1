# PMProject1
Project for Programming Methodology I. This program has the simple goal of performing various matrix operations explicitly.
DO NOT input anything except integers.
The project uses pointers to encoded arrays in which the first two entries describe the size. There are helper functions to decode the matrix indeces and the values themselves.

Crazy how much easier this is to do with Python, MATLAB, or Java, but I actually enjoyed the challenge of implementing concepts from scratch that are not natively supported in the language.
